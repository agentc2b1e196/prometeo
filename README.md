The cause of this repository is free science and technology.

This issue has received some attention in recent years, specially around the field of computer science.

Different movements and actors have fought to defend different positions.

However, it appears there is a general lack of systematic understanding of the issue.

This repository tries to contribute in defining some robust, general principles in order to address the question in a rigorous and systematic manner. This implies, for instance, attempting to make explicit some principles of a theory of science.

This approach also helps understanding the great scope and the deep implications that our posture towards this issue may have in the general development of the sciences, technologies and societies.

This is a work in progress.
